You can either copy the node-router.js file in \nthe same directory as your script and require it with a relative path:\n\n    var NodeRouter = require('./node-router');\n  \nOr you can copy `node-router.js` to somewhere in your `require.paths` array. Then you can use a global require\nlike:\n\n    var NodeRouter = require('node-router');\n    \nSee the [node docs][] for more details.\n\n[node docs]: http://nodejs.org/api.html#_modules\n\n",
